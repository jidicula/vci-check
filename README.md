# vci-check

`vci-check` is a simple web API for checking if a vaccine credential issuer is indeed a trusted issuer. It accepts a GET query at the root endpoint with the issuer URL as a query parameter:

`curl host/?iss=https://totallylegitissuer/creds`

The full list of trusted issuers is available in the [VCI Directory](https://github.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory).

## Deploying

You can deploy it via Docker CLI with `docker run ghcr.io/jidicula/vci-check:latest`

# vci-check/checker

This repo also provides the Go package `checker`, containing types corresponding to the VCI directory and functions for working with them.
